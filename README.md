This project is a web application to create customizable and user-friendly surveys and it is a MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, Node.js) application made of two processes:

1. An Express "server" providing API support for retrieving and submitting data from the backend
2. A React "client" providing a web-based UI
This project also leverages a cloud-based instance of MongoDB for storing and retrieving data.


In a command shell, run the commands:

npm install
npm start
